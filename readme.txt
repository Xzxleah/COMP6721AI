the submitted files includes:

Python code: Data-processing, training and evaluation's python code of partI as well as the python code of bias detection and processing and K-fold cross-validation of partII
     	     Both parts of the training codes could be run directly using python-related software

Dataset: In mask_dataset folder, contains the entire mask image dataset used for training and testing, which including five folders mapped to five mask image categories
	 In Bias_trained_mask_dataset includes the mask image datasets we used for improving the bias of our training model
	 

trained_models: includes the saved trained models generated by the original training code and a new improved training code,
		The testing dataset with corresponding five mask categories and The test codes whose name are test.ipynb,
		The test code of both the original one and the new one can be run directly by using the juptyer notebook,
	      	The test code will provide the best testing performance of our trained model and The evaluation performance can be immediately seen after running the code.
